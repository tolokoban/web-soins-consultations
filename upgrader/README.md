# Upgrader

This is a node script `upgrader.js` that you compile from the typescript `upgrader.ts` with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This upgrader needs two parameters:

* The path of the application code.
* The URL of the sources (for example: [https://tolokoban.github.io/web-soins-consultations](https://tolokoban.github.io/web-soins-consultations)
